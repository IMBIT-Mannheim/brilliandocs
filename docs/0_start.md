## The Knowledge Transfer Challenge

With the growth of our IT environment, the accessibility of information has become a sophisticated adventure. Traditionally, the 6th semester students would pass their hard-earned knowledge to the 4th semester, ensuring the sustainment of our collective wisdom. This crucial handoff, however, encountered stumbling blocks, prompting the need for a thoughtful and accessible solution.
