## Starting the Application
Before initiating the platform, it is essential to consult the [Contributing Guide](/getting-started/contributing) for best practices. Once the repository is cloned, execute `docker-compose up -d` to start the Apache container that launches BrillianIDEAS at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Updating
The absence of npm necessitates manual updates. Compounding this challenge is the end-of-life status of jQuery Mobile, whose final release was in October 2014, and its incompatibility with newer versions of jQuery. Instead of updating this application, it is advisable to consider a transition to a modern technology stack, such as done with [IMBIT-N3XT](imbit-n3xt).
