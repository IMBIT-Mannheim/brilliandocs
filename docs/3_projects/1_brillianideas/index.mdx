## Starting the Application
Before initiating the platform, it is essential to consult the [Contributing Guide](/getting-started/contributing) for best practices. Once the repository is cloned, execute `docker-compose up -d` to start the Apache container that launches BrillianIDEAS at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Updating
The absence of npm necessitates manual updates. Compounding this challenge is the end-of-life status of jQuery Mobile, whose final release was in October 2014, and its incompatibility with newer versions of jQuery. Instead of updating this application, it is advisable to consider a transition to a modern technology stack, such as done with [IMBIT-N3XT](imbit-n3xt).

## Known Issues
- The "Wie dual bin ich" page can not be navigated using the keyboard arrow keys or swipe gestures.
- Given the age of the codebase, there is a heightened risk of unresolved security vulnerabilities (CVEs). It is recommended to isolate this application entirely to mitigate potential risks.

## Pending Tasks
- Evaluate the feasibility of migrating to GitHub Pages, which would require making the repository public. Prior to this, a thorough review is needed to ensure no sensitive information is disclosed.
- Perform an update of the website content ALTERNATIVELY migrate more information to [IMBIT-N3XT](https://imbit-n3xt.com).
