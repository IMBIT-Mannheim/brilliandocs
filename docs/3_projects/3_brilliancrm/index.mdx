## User Management

### Roles

In BrillianCRM, there are three distinct roles with different levels of access and functionalities. Each role has access to different servlets and JSPs that are appropriate for their level of access and functionalities in the application. Access control is managed using the Apache Shiro security framework, which checks the user's role when loggin in and then grants access to protected routes and functionalities.

1. **Student**: 
   Students are the primary users of the game. They can play the game, make decisions that affect their Time, Cost, and Quality (TCQ) scores, view their progress, and change their own passwords. They interact with various interfaces and scenarios within the game to learn project management concepts.
2. **Professor**:
   Professors have the ability to create and manage student groups, send registration links to students, and track the progress of the students within their groups. Additionally, they can delete groups or students and set the game progress for their students.
3. **Admin**:
   Admins have the highest level of access in the system. They possess all the capabilities of professors but with additional administrative privileges. Admins can create professor accounts, view all professors in the system, manage the global settings (audio, video, etc.), and reset passwords for other users.

### Student Creation
The process for creating students, involves the following steps and classes:

1. **User Registration**
   - The user initiates the registration process by accessing the registration form provided by the `RegisterStudent` servlet. This form includes inputs for necessary details such as name, gender, email, password, and group number (for students).
2. **Form Submission**
   - The form data is submitted to the `CreateUser` servlet, which processes the request.
3. **User Data Validation**
   - The `CreateUser` servlet validates the provided user data to ensure all required fields are filled, passwords match, and the user does not already exist in the database (to avoid duplicates).
4. **Password Encryption**
   - If validation passes, the submitted password is encrypted using the `PasswordEncryptor` class, which uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm. Please note that the Salt is defined twice: once in `PasswordEncryptor.java` in clear text, and then Base64-encoded in `web.xml`.
5. **Database Insertion**
   - The `UserRealm` class handles the insertion of the new user into the database. For student registration, a unique and unverified email (used as a temporary placeholder) is stored in the database until the user confirms their registration via email.
6. **Sending Confirmation Email**
   - For student accounts, a confirmation email is sent using the `MailClient` class. This email contains a unique link that includes an identifier for completing the registration process.
7. **Email Confirmation Handling**
   - When the user clicks the confirmation link in their email, the `ConfirmRegistration` servlet is invoked, which updates the user's temporary email to the actual email address, thus completing the registration process.

### Professor Creation
A default professor account for Bendl is being created in the `cake.sql` file. If more professors are needed, you can do so from the admin interface.

### Password Reset

The password reset process is designed to help users who have forgotten their passwords regain access to their accounts. The process involves the following steps, using the `PasswordReset` servlet and the `MailClient` class:

1. **Password Reset Request**: 
   - The user initiates the request by navigating to the `resetpw.jsp` page and entering their email address.
2. **Email Verification**: 
   - The `PasswordReset` servlet verifies that the email provided is associated with a user account in the system.
3. **Temporary Password Generation**: 
   - The servlet generates a temporary password and encrypts it using `PasswordEncryptor`.
4. **Database Update**: 
   - The encrypted temporary password is then updated in the database for the user's account using the `UserRealm` class.
5. **Email Dispatch**: 
   - The `MailClient` class is used to send an email containing the temporary password to the user's email address.
6. **User Notification**: 
   - The user receives an email with the temporary password and instructions to log in and change their password.
7. **Password Update**: 
   - Upon successful login with the temporary password, the user is advised to update their password to something new and secure.

### Generating Password Hashes
If you need to manually generate password hashes, a class `GenerateHashes` has been created for this very purpose, as it was required when manually defining the default professor and admin accounts in `cake.sql`.
To generate a hash for a custom password, make sure the BrillianCRM docker container is running and then run the following command:

```bash  
docker exec -it brilliancrm java -cp "/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/classes:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/lib/*" org.dhbw.imbit11.backend.GenerateHashes
```

## Mail
The BrillianCRM/ICM applications have experienced mail sending issues in the past. Now that the application is using the latest version of [Jakarta Mail](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.sun.mail/jakarta.mail) (2.0.1) and has all the security features implemented, these issues should not occur in the near future. However if issues arise, these are the involved classes that send mails:

1. **MailClient**
   - The `MailClient` class is the primary utility that handles the composition and sending of emails. It uses the JavaMail API to construct and send both HTML and plain text emails via SMTP.
2. **PasswordReset**
   - The `PasswordReset` servlet uses the `MailClient` class to send a temporary password to users who have requested to reset their password.
3. **CreateUser**
   - The `CreateUser` servlet uses the `MailClient` class to send confirmation emails to new students, containing the link to verify their email address and complete the registration process.
4. **SendRegistrationLink**
   - The `SendRegistrationLink` servlet is used by professors to send out registration links to new users. It also utilizes the `MailClient` class to send the email containing the registration link.

## Database Structure

The database structure for **BrillianCRM** is defined within the `cake.sql` script. This script establishes the schema for the BrillianCRM database which consists of several key tables that manage user information, group associations, settings preferences, and user progress within the CRM game. It also automatically creates default professor and admin accounts which are stored in Bitwarden.

#### `group`
This table holds information about groups within the application, each identified by a unique `GROUP_ID`. Groups can be associated with a `PROFESSOR_ID`, indicating the professor who manages the group. Additional details like the group's name, organization, description, and URL are stored within this table.

#### `settings`
A simple table that stores global settings for the application with regard to audio, video, text-to-speech, and subtitle preferences.

#### `user`
The `user` table is central to the application's user management. It stores user credentials, names, roles, and registration dates. Each user is assigned a unique `USER_ID`. Users can be linked to groups and have roles such as 'student', 'professor', or 'admin'.

#### `user_progress`
This table tracks the progress of users in the game. It ties a `USER_ID` to various metrics like cost, quality, and time, which are core to the game's learning objectives. A `PATH` field is available for storing a text representation of the user’s progress through the game's storyline.

### Relationships

- `group` has a foreign key to `user` indicating the professor responsible for the group.
- `user` has an optional foreign key to `group`, allowing the association of users with groups.
- `user_progress` is linked to `user`, ensuring that progress is tied directly to an individual user's record.

### Initial Data and Constraints

The script includes initial insertions for groups and settings, as well as two user accounts, one for a professor and one for an admin. Referential integrity is maintained through foreign key constraints with cascade updates and deletes, ensuring that related data remains consistent throughout the database operations.

### Remarks

The use of `AUTO_INCREMENT` for primary keys ensures that new records are assigned unique identifiers without manual intervention. The database uses the `utf8` character set with the `utf8_unicode_ci` collation, which supports internationalization and case-insensitive text storage.

### Dockerfile_mariadb
A custom MariaDB image is created for the sole purpose of copying `cake.sql` into the `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/` directory of MariaDB.
Any .sql file in this directory will be executed on the first boot of the MariaDB container. You could try to mount the `cake.sql` directly on a standard MariaDB container, but the current approach is preferred for AWS, as this way nothing needs to be updated on AWS and the complete settings are on GitHub. 

## Update Limitations

Due to compatibility issues, further updating of the application's core components has been halted:

- **Tomcat 10**: Upgrade not possible because it drops the `javax` namespace. Our Fileupload Plugin doesn't support the new `jakarta` namespace yet. A new version must be first awaited.
- **Shiro Web Plugin (v2.0.0)**: Recent upgrade breaks the Password Encryption class with no available fix due to the current lack of official documentation from Shiro Web.
