## Introduction

IMBIT-PIXELS was originally created by the IMBIT22B class. 

Further deployment steps are done by the IMBIT22A class. 


## Key Development Guidelines

Branching Strategy:
For each new feature, create a separate branch.
This promotes modular development and prevents conflicts.
Once a feature is complete and tested, merge the branch into the DEV branch.
Framework Adherence:
The game is built using the "Kaplay" framework.
All code changes must be consistent with Kaplay's conventions and best practices.
Refer to the Kaplay documentation ( https://kaplayjs.com/) for guidance.
File Restrictions:
Do not modify vite.config.js. This file is crucial for building the game.


## File Overview

kaboom.ctx.js:
This file is specifically for adapting the game to different screen sizes.
Changes here likely involve responsive design or scaling logic.
constant.js:
This file stores constants used throughout the game, such as:
Dialog text
Game settings
Any values that might need to be easily changed
index.html:
This is the main HTML file that defines the structure of the game's web page.
Modifications here would involve changes to the HTML elements displayed in the game.
main.js:
This file contains the core game logic and functions.
Most of your feature development will likely occur in this file.
utils.js:
This file holds configuration settings that are separate from the Kaplay framework.
It might include game balance parameters or custom settings.
How to Apply These Guidelines

## Feature Branching:

Before starting a new feature (e.g., "Inventory System"), create a branch named feature/inventory-system.
Work exclusively within that branch.
When the feature is complete and tested, merge it into the DEV branch.

## Kaplay Compliance:

Always consult the Kaplay documentation to ensure your code is compatible with the framework.
Use Kaplay's built-in functions and structures whenever possible.
Avoid directly manipulating the DOM unless necessary and Kaplay doesn't provide a suitable alternative.

## File Management:

Be mindful of which file you're editing.
If you're changing game logic, it's probably main.js.
If you're tweaking UI layout, it might be index.html or kaboom.ctx.js.
If you're adding new text or configuration, consider constant.js or utils.js.
Never edit vite.config.js.



## Dialogue System Documentation
The `Dialogue` class manages in-game dialogues, including text display with typing effects and multiple-choice questions. The system displays dialogue boxes with text and optional answers for the player to select.

### Initializing the Dialogue System

This is already implemented in the main.js class. There should only exist one dialogue object at the same time.
```javascript
// Create a new dialogue instance
const dialogue = new Dialogue();
```

### Displaying Dialogues
You can display a single dialogue or a sequence of dialogues:

```javascript
// Single dialogue
dialogue.display({
    title: "Character Name",
    text: "Hello, welcome to the game!",
    answers: [],
    correctAnswer: 0
}, onDialogueComplete);

// Multiple dialogues in sequence
dialogue.display([
    {
        title: "Guide",
        text: "First message in sequence.",
        answers: [],
        correctAnswer: 0
    },
    {
        title: "Guide",
        text: "Second message will display after the first.",
        answers: [],
        correctAnswer: 0
    }
], onDialogueComplete);
```

### Adding Quiz Questions

Dialogues can include multiple-choice questions:

```javascript
dialogue.display({
    id: "quiz_1",  // Unique ID for score tracking
    title: "Quiz",
    text: "What is the capital of France?",
    answers: ["London", "Paris", "Berlin", "Madrid"],
    correctAnswer: 2,  // Paris (index+1)
    correctText: "Correct! Paris is the capital of France.",
    wrongText: "Sorry, that's incorrect. The capital of France is Paris."
}, onDialogueComplete);
```

### Handling Dialogue Completion

The callback function is executed when all dialogues in a sequence are complete. It can be used to run specific code or trigger actions after the user has seen a given dialogue:

```javascript
function onDialogueComplete() {
    console.log("Dialogue sequence completed");
    // Resume game or trigger next action
}
```


### Question Button Click Listener

You can listen for button clicks regardless of correctness. This is useful for triggering specific actions based on the selected response:

```javascript
dialogueSystem.setQuestionButtonClickListener((buttonNumber) => {
    console.log(`Player clicked button ${buttonNumber}`);
    // Perform custom actions based on selection
});
```

### Checking Dialogue State
This is useful to check if currently a dialogue is presented to the user.

```javascript
if (dialogueSystem.inDialogue()) {
    // Player is currently in a dialogue
    // Game might want to pause other systems
}
```
