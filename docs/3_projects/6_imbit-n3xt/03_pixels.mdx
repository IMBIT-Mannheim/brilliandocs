## Introduction

IMBIT-PIXELS was originally created by the IMBIT22B class. 

Further deployment steps are done by the IMBIT22A class. 


## Key Development Guidelines

Branching Strategy:
For each new feature, create a separate branch.
This promotes modular development and prevents conflicts.
Once a feature is complete and tested, merge the branch into the DEV branch.
Framework Adherence:
The game is built using the "Kaplay" framework.
All code changes must be consistent with Kaplay's conventions and best practices.
Refer to the Kaplay documentation ( https://kaplayjs.com/) for guidance.
File Restrictions:
Do not modify vite.config.js. This file is crucial for building the game.


## File Overview

kaboom.ctx.js:
This file is specifically for adapting the game to different screen sizes.
Changes here likely involve responsive design or scaling logic.
constant.js:
This file stores constants used throughout the game, such as:
Dialog text
Game settings
Any values that might need to be easily changed
index.html:
This is the main HTML file that defines the structure of the game's web page.
Modifications here would involve changes to the HTML elements displayed in the game.
main.js:
This file contains the core game logic and functions.
Most of your feature development will likely occur in this file.
utils.js:
This file holds configuration settings that are separate from the Kaplay framework.
It might include game balance parameters or custom settings.
How to Apply These Guidelines

## Feature Branching:

Before starting a new feature (e.g., "Inventory System"), create a branch named feature/inventory-system.
Work exclusively within that branch.
When the feature is complete and tested, merge it into the DEV branch.

## Kaplay Compliance:

Always consult the Kaplay documentation to ensure your code is compatible with the framework.
Use Kaplay's built-in functions and structures whenever possible.
Avoid directly manipulating the DOM unless necessary and Kaplay doesn't provide a suitable alternative.

## File Management:

Be mindful of which file you're editing.
If you're changing game logic, it's probably main.js.
If you're tweaking UI layout, it might be index.html or kaboom.ctx.js.
If you're adding new text or configuration, consider constant.js or utils.js.
Never edit vite.config.js.
