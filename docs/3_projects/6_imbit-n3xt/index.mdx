## Introduction

IMBIT-N3XT was originally created by the IMBIT20 class. The IMBIT21A course implemented the translation functionality, and the IMBIT21B course reworked the entire application on a technical level. They adapted the design and made it responsive, completely redesigned the TinBit application, and implemented best practices. You can find the first version of the website at http://old.imbit-n3xt.com.

## CloudFront Behavior Configuration for Brotli Compression

:::note Effect on Deployment Time
Disabling the compression results in an immediate deployment if the repository is updated.
:::

The CloudFront behavior has been configured to automatically compress objects using Brotli compression, which is a deviation from the standard behavior where compression is not enabled by default. This change aims to improve content delivery by reducing file sizes, leading to faster downloads and potential cost savings on data transfer.

### Differences from Standard Behavior

The following settings have been modified from the standard behavior to enable Brotli compression:

- **Compress Objects Automatically**: Changed from "No" to "Yes" to enable automatic compression of objects that CloudFront determines are eligible for compression.
- **Viewer Protocol Policy**: Set to "Redirect HTTP to HTTPS" to ensure that Brotli compression is used, as it is only supported over HTTPS.
- **Cache Policy**: Configured to "CachingOptimized," which supports both Gzip and Brotli compression. This differs from the standard behavior where compression may not be enabled by default.

### Unchanged Settings

The following settings remain unchanged from the standard behavior:

- **Allowed HTTP Methods**: Set to "GET, HEAD," which specifies the HTTP methods that CloudFront allows and caches.
- **Cache Key and Origin Requests**: Using the recommended "Cache policy and origin request policy" instead of "Legacy cache settings," which determines how CloudFront includes query strings, cookies, and headers in the cache key and forwards requests to the origin.
- **Origin Request Policy**: No specific policy selected, maintaining the default behavior of forwarding all headers, cookies, and query strings to the origin.
- **Response Headers Policy**: No specific policy selected, meaning CloudFront does not modify the response headers from the origin.

## General Project Structure

The code of the application is modularly structured in the [`src`](https://github.com/IMBIT-Mannheim/imbit-n3xt/tree/master/src) folder. It contains the `index` files, the `components`, and the `pages`. You can find explanations for each of these below.

There are a few other important folders. `.ebextensions` contains the configuration file for the Nginx setup of Elastic Beanstalk. `.github` contains the deployment workflow via GitHub Actions - it should be self-explanatory. `.vscode` contains a recommendation of extensions for VSCode that should be installed. When first opening the project, the user is asked if they want to install the extensions (enforcing all extensions is not recommended, so it is not done). It also contains a few workspace settings to ensure consistent formatting and syntax settings.

### Index

The `index.js` file sets up the application by configuring routing, internationalization, and essential components. It manages the application's main structure, including the translation functionality (`IntlProvider`), the routes for navigation (including routing to an Error 404/Not found page), and the main UI components like the `Navbar`, the `FaviconSwitcher`, the `ChatbotScript` (refer to the [Chatbot](./imbit-n3xt/chatbase) section), and the `Footer`.

It also sets up the basic `Helmet` functionality. Anything you want to load on absolutely **every page** should be included in this Helmet component in the index file.

If you are wondering why the whole app is in strict mode... It makes you more aware of any errors the app encounters. Sometimes, some errors don't stop the app from working, but they would pop up in the console. This React feature makes it hard to overlook any critical errors because it displays the error message prominently.

```js
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <RootApp />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

The `index.css` file includes the most basic CSS styles. It is self-explanatory.

Use the `padding-container` for proper left and right padding of all components. It is its own CSS class because sometimes it is not the top-level element of a component when there is a background and the main content of the component should not be too wide. The same applies to the `padding-top` class, which ensures consistent spacing between each component.

### Pages

The `pages` folder contains all the pages of the website. Each page consists of different components and gets routed to via the `index.js` file. Be aware that the `International.js` page is currently not in use as there is no styling and there were no resources available to design and style the page properly. Each page should include its `<title>`. Components that are unlikely to be rendered when entering the page due to being outside of the viewport should be lazy-loaded with `<Suspense>`. See the example below.

```js
const Metaverse = lazy(() => import('./Metaverse.js'));

const [pagename] = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Suspense>
        <Metaverse />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Components

The `components` folder contains all components of the project. They are grouped into the different pages or, if they are reusable, into `general`. The `styling` folder contains all styling for each component. The .css files are named exactly like the component, so it is easily assignable. If a component loads data, the data is in the `data` folder. All media used by the components are in the `media` folder, which is grouped into different categories of media. The media and data files are not named systematically - if you have time, please rename them systematically.

## Formatting & Best Practices

To unify all code written so that every developer commits with the same formatting, we used a few tools.

### CSS Naming convention

The name of a BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) entity is unique. The same BEM entity always has the same name in all technologies (CSS, JavaScript, and HTML). The primary purpose of the naming convention is to give names meaning so that they are as informative as possible for the developer. For more information refer to https://en.bem.info/methodology/naming-convention/ and https://getbem.com/naming/.

#### Naming rules

`block-name__elem-name_mod-name_mod-val`

- Names are written in lowercase Latin letters.
- Words are separated by a hyphen (-).
- The block name defines the namespace for its elements and modifiers.
- The element name is separated from the block name by a double underscore (\_\_).
- The modifier name is separated from the block or element name by a single underscore (\_).
- The modifier value is separated from the modifier name by a single underscore (\_).
- For boolean modifiers, the value is not included in the name.
- Important: Elements of elements do not exist in the BEM methodology. The naming rules do not allow creating elements of elements, but you can nest elements inside each other in the DOM tree.

### Babel

Babel is a popular transpiler that allows us to use future JavaScript in today’s browsers. In simple words, it can convert the latest version of JavaScript code into one that the browser understands. A transpiler is a tool used to convert source code into another source code of the same level. The latest standard version that JavaScript follows is ES2020, which is not fully supported by all browsers; hence we use Babel to convert it into code that today’s browsers understand. We use Babel with React to transpile the JSX code into simple React functions that browsers can understand. This ensures that our JSX code can work in almost any browser. This combination is widely used in modern web development.

### GitHub

We used `.editorconfig` and `.gitattributes` to tell GitHub to change all line endings into "lf" and to ensure that each file ends with a new line. CLRF and LF are used to mark a line break. Different OS platforms use different line endings, so we decided to force the use of LF for all line breaks across all files and platforms. Even if your computer stores it differently, GitHub changes the line endings upon commit.

### ESLint

ESLint is a popular open-source JavaScript linting utility. It analyzes your code for potential errors, enforces coding standards, and improves code quality. It can also help you identify and fix common mistakes, use best practices, and maintain consistency across your codebase.

See inline documentation in `.eslint.cjs` for more information.

### Prettier

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.

- **endOfLine**: `"lf"` - Enforces the use of Unix-style line endings (LF) across the project.
- **singleQuote**: `true` - Ensures that single quotes are used instead of double quotes in the code.
- **trailingComma**: `"all"` - Adds a trailing comma wherever possible, which helps in cleaner git diffs.
- **useTabs**: `false` - Enforces the use of spaces instead of tabs for indentation.
- **semi**: `true` - Ensures that semicolons are used at the end of statements.
- **quoteProps**: `"consistent"` - Ensures that object properties are quoted consistently. If one property in an object requires quotes, then all properties will be quoted.
- **jsxSingleQuote**: `true` - Ensures that single quotes are used in JSX attributes instead of double quotes.
- **printWidth**: `80` - Sets the maximum line width to 80 characters for better readability.
- **overrides**: Custom configurations for specific file types.
  - **files**: `"*.css"` - Targets all CSS files in the project.
  - **options**:
    - **singleQuote**: `true` - Ensures that single quotes are used in CSS files as well.

### TypeScript

TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript that adds static typing. This means

that TypeScript adds syntax on top of JavaScript, allowing developers to add types. TypeScript being a "syntactic superset" means that it shares the same base syntax as JavaScript but adds additional features. JavaScript is a loosely typed language, making it difficult to understand what types of data are being passed around. In JavaScript, function parameters and variables don't have any type information. Developers need to look at documentation or guess based on implementation. TypeScript allows specifying the types of data being passed around within the code and has the ability to report errors when the types don't match. For example, TypeScript will report an error when passing a string into a function that expects a number. JavaScript will not.

## Sitemap Generation

For generating a sitemap, use the `sitemap-builder.js` file. In the `sitemap-routes.js` file, all pages are specified, including the priority which must be specified. When a new page is introduced, update this file. Afterwards, run `node ./src/sitemap-builder.js` in the CLI to generate a new sitemap.

## Other

### Webhint

When you open the `report.html` file, you'll see a Webhint report. Webhint is a linting tool focused on best practices. It helps improve the site's accessibility, speed, cross-browser compatibility, and more by checking the code for best practices and common errors. You can find areas to improve in this report.

### Prerendered

In the `prerendered` folder, you will find a prerendered version of each page. You can generate a new version by running `node ./prerender.mjs`. The prerendered page is without styling and should be presented to crawlers if set up correctly. At the time of writing, this is not used.
