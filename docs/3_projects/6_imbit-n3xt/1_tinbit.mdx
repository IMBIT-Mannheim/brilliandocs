## Data sources

The data of the companies, lecturers and alumni are stored in three central data files (German, English and Spanish translation) in the data sub
folder inside the tinbit component folder. They are structured as a JSON file format and new entries can easily be added by copying the structure
of one entry and pasting it at the end of each object. Don't forget to also add new images then.

:::tip
You should regularly check the current status of the partner companies and possibly also the lecturers, as they change frequently.

### Shuffling the data

In order to randomize the order of the cards when accessing the page a shuffle function is applied in the data files. It is located here to ensure
that the cards do not get shuffled when remounting the TinBit components, just when reloading the page.

```js
const shuffleArray = (array) => {
  const shuffledArray = array.slice(); // Create a copy of the array
  for (let i = shuffledArray.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
    const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
    [shuffledArray[i], shuffledArray[j]] = [shuffledArray[j], shuffledArray[i]];
  }
  return shuffledArray;
};
```

## Animations

For animations the [Framer Motion library](https://www.framer.com/motion/ 'Framer Motion library') was used. It handles

- the fade-out and -in of the start screen
- the swiping of the cards
- the transitions between the different card decks
- the slide-in and out of the card switch and favorites containers
- the heart animation when liking a company
- and the cards moving to the front when one card is swiped

The most complex one is probably the swiping animation. It is configured in the component `SwipeCard.js`.

```js
      <motion.div
        className={`card-container ${flipped ? 'card-container--flipped' : ''}`}
        style={{
          x: index === 0 ? x : 0,
          rotate,
          zIndex: 3 - index,
          transform: `scale(${1 - index * 0.06})`,
          transition: 'transform 0.1s ease-out, opacity 0.1s ease-out',
          position: 'absolute',
          top: 0,
          left: 0,
        }}
        drag={index === 0 ? 'x' : false}
        dragConstraints={{ left: -150, right: 150 }}
        dragElastic={0.1}
        onDragEnd={handleDragEnd}
        animate={controls}
        initial={{ top: index * 20, scale: 1 - index * 0.05 }}
        whileTap={{ cursor: index === 0 ? 'grabbing' : 'default' }}
      >
```

The attribut `motion` is a framer motion specific addition, that can be added to any HTML or SVG element that you want to animate.
It also lets you add props to further control and specify the animation. In the following the framer motion specific props are explained further:

| Prop              | Description                                                 | Customization Effects                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `drag`            | Enables dragging along the x-axis for the top card.         | Customizing this to `'x'`, `'y'`, or `true` can change the dragging direction or enable free dragging. |
| `dragConstraints` | Limits the dragging range horizontally.                     | Adjusting the constraints changes how far the card can be dragged.                                     |
| `dragElastic`     | Sets the elasticity of dragging.                            | Increasing elasticity makes the drag motion more bouncy, while decreasing makes it more rigid.         |
| `onDragEnd`       | Callback function triggered when dragging ends.             | Customizing this can change what happens when a drag action is completed (e.g., logging, animation).   |
| `animate`         | Controls the current animation state of the component.      | Changing the animation controls can alter the animation flow and behavior.                             |
| `initial`         | Defines the initial animation state.                        | Customizing the initial state can change how cards appear when they first render.                      |
| `initial.top`     | Sets the initial top position.                              | Adjusting this can change the staggered vertical placement of cards.                                   |
| `initial.scale`   | Sets the initial scale of the card.                         | Customizing this can affect the initial size and depth appearance of the cards.                        |
| `whileTap`        | Changes the cursor style when the card is tapped (clicked). | Modifying this can change the cursor feedback during drag interactions.                                |
