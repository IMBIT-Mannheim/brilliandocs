[https://imbit.brillianideas.com](https://imbit.brillianideas.com) is an unfinished, legacy webpage that originates from an effort in 2021 under the guidance of Prof. Krug. This site serves as an information hub created by and for the students of IMBIT@DHBW-Mannheim.

The platform is built on Wordpress and is currently hosted on AWS Lightsail. For administrative tasks you can access the [Wordpress admin interface](https://imbit.brillianideas.com/wp-admin) and access the Shell through [AWS Lightsail's management console](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/).
