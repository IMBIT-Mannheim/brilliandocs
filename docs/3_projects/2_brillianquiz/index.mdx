## Introduction
BrillianQUIZ is an interactive web-based quiz platform designed to engage users in a dynamic learning experience. Built with modern web technologies, BrillianQUIZ provides a user-friendly interface, instant feedback on quiz performance, and a comprehensive set of tools for educators to create and manage courses and quizzes.
BrillianQUIZ is compromised of two parts - the backend (server logic) and the frontend (user interface).

|-----------|---------------|----------------------------|------------|----------|--------------|------------|
| BrillianQUIZ | https://brillianquiz.com | https://github.com/imbit-mannheim/brillianquiz | Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose. Frontend: Vue.js, Vite, Pinia, Vue Router | MongoDB  | x86         | AWS |

## Backend
The backend of BrillianQUIZ serves as the backbone of the platform, handling all server-side logic, data storage, API requests, and responses. The backend manages user authentication, course and quiz data, and provides endpoints for the frontend to retrieve and modify data.

### Directory Structure

The codebase is organized into the following directories:
- `./backend/controllers`: Contains logic for handling incoming requests and returning responses.
- `./backend/database`: Contains the data to configure and initialize the database with data.
- `./backend/docs/`: Documentation location that the Swagger API loads.
- `./backend/models/`: Contains Mongoose schemas that define the structure of documents in MongoDB.
- `./backend/routes/`: Defines the HTTP endpoints of the application and maps them to controller functions.
- `./backend/utils/`: Includes utility functions and classes that are used across the application such as mail sending and error handling.
- `./backend/views/`: Contains the styles and content for the mail that are being sent.
- `./backend/index.js`: Main file loading the application, dependencies, middleware and routes.

### Controllers

Controllers handle incoming HTTP requests, interact with the database, and return responses. Some of the key controllers include:

- `authController.js`: Handles authentication and authorization features including signup, login, password management, and access control.
- `categoryController.js`: Manages operations related to quiz categories.
- `courseController.js`: Responsible for course management, including CRUD operations and student enrollment.
- `errorController.js`: Centralized error handling mechanism for the application.
- `handlerFactory.js`: Provides generic functions for CRUD operations that can be reused across different data models.
- `questionController.js`: Manages quiz questions, including creating, updating, and deleting questions.
- `subjectController.js`: Contains functions for subject management, related to quiz categories.
- `submissionController.js`: Processes quiz submissions and evaluates them.
- `userController.js`: Manages user data, including CRUD operations and self-service functions for updating user information and handling submissions.

### Models

Models define the structure and behavior of data entities in MongoDB. They are built using Mongoose and include:

- `categoryModel.js`: Represents a quiz category.
- `courseModel.js`: Represents a course, including its name, professor, and enrolled students.
- `questionModel.js`: Defines a quiz question, including types such as single choice, multiple choice, etc.
- `subjectModel.js`: Represents a subject, which is linked to a category and can contain multiple questions.
- `submissionModel.js`: Represents a submission of answers by a user for a given subject.
- `userModel.js`: Defines a user, including personal details, role, and password management fields.

### Routes

Routes define the API's endpoints and associate them with controller functions. They are grouped by functionality:

- `quizCategoryRoutes.js`: Endpoints related to quiz categories.
- `quizCourseRoutes.js`: Endpoints for course management.
- `quizQuestionRoutes.js`: API routes for handling quiz questions.
- `quizSubjectRoutes.js`: Endpoints for subject-related operations.
- `userRoutes.js`: User-related endpoints, including authentication and self-service operations.

### Utils

Utility files include common functions and classes that are used throughout the application:

- `appError.js`: Defines a custom `AppError` class for consistent error handling.
- `asyncForEach.js`: Provides an asynchronous version of the `forEach` loop.
- `catchAsync.js`: A higher-order function to catch errors in asynchronous functions.
- `email.js`: Contains the `Email` class to send emails using Nodemailer.
- `filterObject.js`: A utility function to filter object properties based on allowed fields.

### API Documentation

The application provides a Swagger documentation interface for the API. Once the application is running, you can access the documentation at `/docs` to explore the available endpoints, their parameters, and responses.

### Error Handling

The application has a global error controller (`errorController.js`) that captures and processes errors throughout the application. It distinguishes between operational errors (e.g., invalid input data) and programming errors, ensuring that the client receives meaningful error messages while sensitive information is protected.

### Security Measures

The application includes several security measures:
- `helmet` for setting HTTP headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities.
- `express-rate-limit` to limit repeated requests to public APIs from a single IP address.
- Data sanitization to prevent NoSQL injection (`express-mongo-sanitize`) and XSS attacks (`xss-clean`).
- `hpp` to prevent HTTP parameter pollution.

### Authentication and Authorization

The application uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. The `authController.js` manages token generation, verification, and the implementation of protected routes. Users are assigned roles (`student`, `professor`, `admin`), and access to certain endpoints is restricted based on these roles.

### Views Directory

The `./backend/views` directory contains Pug templates for the email system. Pug is a high-performance template engine heavily influenced by Haml and implemented with JavaScript for Node.js and browsers.

- `emailstyle.pug`: Defines the CSS styles used by the email templates.

- `baseemail.pug`: The base Pug template that sets up the HTML structure for emails. It provides a responsive layout with a header, main content area, and footer. Other email templates extend this base template.

- `passwordreset.pug`: An email template for sending password reset instructions.

- `welcome.pug`: A welcome email template for new users.

Despite having a `passwordreset.pug` template the app does not currently implement a web-based password reset feature!

### Database Directory

The `./backend/database` directory contains scripts and data for initializing and populating the MongoDB database.

- `config.js`: Establishes a connection to the MongoDB database.

- `initialize.js`: The main script responsible for initializing the database. It connects to the database, and if the `DATABASE_DATA_POPULATION_INITIAL_SETUP` environment variable is set to `true`, it populates the database with initial data.

#### Data Scripts

- `courses.js`: Contains a function to create initial courses and assign professors to them based on the `PROFESSOR_*` environment variables.

- `questions.js`: Reads questions from a JSON file (`questions_data.json`) and inserts them into the database.

- `subjects.js`: Defines a function to create subjects and assign them to categories. It contains predefined subjects and descriptions mapped to category names.

- `users.js`: Includes a function to create initial user accounts, such as an admin and professors, based on environment variables. It also creates a dummy user account with the predefined `62657cd392fe186ae556620b` id for taking quizzes anonymously.

#### Data Files

- `questions_data.json`: A JSON file containing the complete quiz questions. The `questions.js` script reads data from this file to populate the questions in the database.

### Environment Variables

The backend's configuration can be managed through these environment variables specified in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

## Frontend

BrillianQUIZ's frontend is crafted with a component-driven architecture, state management using Pinia, and client-side routing with Vue Router. It communicates with the backend REST API to present users with real-time data and interactive capabilities.

### Directory Structure
- `./frontend/public`: Contains static assets that are directly served by the web server.
  - `./assets`: Further organized into `animated/`, `background/`, `quizmeerestiere/` subfolders, and contains various mediafiles files.
  - `./favicon.ico`: The application's favicon icon.
  - `./horns.cur`: A custom cursor file.
  - `./robots.txt`: Provides web crawler instructions (currently allowing all).
- `./frontend/router`: Defines the Vue router configuration. Contains `index.js`.
- `./frontend/src`: The source directory containing Vue components, CSS, helpers, stores, and views.
  - `./components`: Custom Vue components used across the application.
  - `./css`: Global styles, variables, and specific styles for admin pages and fonts.
  - `./helpers`: Containing the Axios configuration with a base URL for API requests. It also sets up an interceptor to handle error messages coming from the API.
  - `./stores`: State management stores using Pinia.
  - `./views`: Vue components representing pages navigable via the Vue router.
- `./frontend/main.js`: The main entry point of the application creates the Vue application instance, sets up routing with Vue Router, state management with Pinia, and adds head management with `@vueuse/head`.

## Database Structure Documentation

The database structure for BrillianQUIZ is designed using MongoDB, a NoSQL document database. It consists of several collections, each representing different aspects of the application:

### Collections and Schemas

#### `Category`
This collection holds the categories under which subjects are grouped.

- `name`: String, required, unique.
- `image`: String, optional.
- `description`: String, optional.
- `subjects`: Virtual, populates related subjects.

#### `Course`
Represents a course that contains a name, a professor, and enrolled students.

- `name`: String, required, unique.
- `professor`: Object ID reference to `User`, required, must be a professor.
- `students`: Array of Object ID references to `User`, optional, must be students.

#### `Question`
Defines quiz questions with various types (e.g., single choice, multiple choice).

- `subject`: String, required, matches a subject's name.
- `subjectId`: Object ID reference to `Subject`.
- `type`: String, required, enum (specific question types).
- `active`: Boolean, required.
- `question`: String, required.
- `answers`: Array of Strings, required.
- `correctAnswers`: Array of Numbers, required, not exposed by default.
- `titles`: Array of Strings, conditional, based on question type.

#### `Subject`
Represents a subject linked to a category with multiple questions.

- `name`: String, required, unique.
- `categoryId`: Object ID reference to `Category`, required.
- `description`: String, required.
- `image`: String, optional.
- `questions`: Virtual, populates related questions.

#### `Submission`
Represents a submission of answers by a user for a given subject.

- `subjectId`: Object ID reference to `Subject`, required.
- `userId`: Object ID reference to `User`, required.
- `date`: Date, required.
- `questions`: Array of `submittedQuestionSchema`.
- `pointsMax`: Number, optional.
- `pointsGained`: Number, optional.

##### `submittedQuestionSchema` (subdocument in `Submission`)
Defines submitted questions in a quiz attempt.

- `questionId`: Object ID reference to `Question`, unique within submission.
- `answersGiven`: Array of Numbers, required.
- `answersEvaluated`: Array of Booleans, required.
- `pointsGained`: Number, optional.
- `pointsMax`: Number, optional.

#### `User`
Defines a user with roles (e.g., student, professor, admin).

- `firstName`: String, required.
- `lastName`: String, required.
- `email`: String, required, unique, validated.
- `role`: String, enum (student, professor, admin).
- `password`: String, required, not exposed by default.
- `passwordConfirm`: String, required, for validation only.
- `passwordChangedAt`: Date, optional.
- `passwordResetToken`: String, optional, not exposed by default.
- `passwordResetExpires`: Date, optional, not exposed by default.
- `active`: Boolean, default true, not exposed by default.
- `courses`: Virtual, populates courses the user is enrolled in.
- `coursesIManage`: Virtual, populates courses the user manages (professors).

### Relationships

Many of the collections are related to one another through Object ID references. MongoDB does not enforce these relationships, but the application logic ensures integrity. Here is an overview of the relationships:

- A `Category` has many `Subjects` through the `categoryId` field.
- A `Subject` belongs to one `Category` and has many `Questions` through the `subjectId` field.
- A `Course` is related to a `User` (professor) and has many `Users` (students).
- A `Question` is related to a `Subject`.
- A `Submission` is related to a `User` and a `Subject` and contains many `submittedQuestionSchema` subdocuments, which in turn reference `Questions`.
- A `User` can have many `Submissions`, be enrolled in many `Courses` as a student, and manage many `Courses` as a professor.

### Indexing Strategy

Indexes improve query performance. Given the relational nature of the data models and the common query patterns, the following fields are indexed:

- `email` in `User` (unique index for quick lookups by email).
- `name` in `Category`, `Subject`, and `Course` (unique indexes for name-based lookups).

### Security Considerations

Sensitive fields, particularly those related to user authentication (`password`, `passwordResetToken`, `passwordResetExpires`), are marked as not exposed by default. They can only be explicitly selected when necessary for security operations.
