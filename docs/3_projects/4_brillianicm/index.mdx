BrillianICM shares its origins with BrillianCRM, both emerging from the same initial codebase in 2011. However, it's important to recognize that BrillianCRM, being the newer system, has undergone more frequent updates in recent years. Consequently, BrillianICM's functionality hasn't been revisited for an extended period.
