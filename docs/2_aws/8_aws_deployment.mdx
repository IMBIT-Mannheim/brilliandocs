title: Continuous Deployment
---

Each application has an automated deployment pipeline. This is a GitHub Action in the application's repository found in `.github/workflows/deploy-AWS.yml`. The pipeline is triggered when commits are pushed to the `main` branch.

## Key Steps of the Workflow:

1. **Build Process**:
   The workflow initiates by building Docker images based on the Dockerfile(s) present in the repository.

2. **Image Registry**:
   Once the Docker images are built, they are pushed to the GitHub Container Registry, which is cheaper than hosting them on AWS.

3. **Elastic Beanstalk Deployment**:
   In the final step, the images are deployed to the specified AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment.

:::caution In case of deployment failure:
- All GitHub packages are private by default. Set them to public after the initial release. For more, see [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/learn-github-packages/configuring-a-packages-access-control-and-visibility).
- Maintain the application and environment names the same in the GitHub workflow and Elastic Beanstalk configuration!
