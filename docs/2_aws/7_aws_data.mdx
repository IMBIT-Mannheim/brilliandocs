## Data Location and Recreation

All application code and configuration are on GitHub, so you can recreate every application. Even if everything is deleted, the applications will recreate their databases to a working state. Administrator and professor accounts are hardcoded.

The [Wordpress Page](/projects/other/wordpress) is not documentated, neither is there a repository on GitHub. A backup might be advisable.

## Data Loss Potential

:::info

::: 

- **Affected Data**: Since the app launched, user accounts and password changes from professor accounts would be lost. 
- **Applications Affected**: BrillianQUIZ ([Important Info äää](/projects/brillianquiz)), BrillianCRM, and BrillianICM.
- **Recovery Approach**: Users can re-register their account, thus to keep costs low a formal backup strategy is not deemed critical.
