## Joining the IMBIT GitHub Organization

You can access the source code for all applications once you're part of the [IMBIT-Mannheim GitHub Organization](https://github.com/IMBIT-Mannheim). Please respect, that we need to keep all ongoing and future initiatives in that GitHub organization.

If you want to contribute and need access, send a join request to our contact. You'll find their details at the end of this section.

## Managing Digital Credentials with Bitwarden

We've chosen [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com), an user-friendly online password manager to simplify password sharing.

### Obtaining Bitwarden Credentials

To find the Bitwarden account credentials:

- Check the GitHub repository äää URL.
- Alternatively, request them from the students from higher semesters.

## Reaching Out for Access

If you're uncertain about how to proceed or whom to contact for access, follow these steps:

1. Ask the Studiengangsleitung (head of the degree program) for the name of the last person responsible for the resources you're interested in.
2. Contact that individual to obtain both Bitwarden credentials and a GitHub invitation.
3. In case you hit a dead end, don't worry—the contacts below can help you out.
