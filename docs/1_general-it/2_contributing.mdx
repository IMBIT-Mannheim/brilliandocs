## Development Setup

### Getting Started with the Repository

After joining the GitHub organization, you'll need to clone the specific IMBIT application repository to your local machine using your preferred IDE, such as Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ.

### Local vs. AWS Development

While AWS dev instances were previously used for testing, local development with Docker is now preferred due to its speed, cost efficiency, and simplicity.

## x86 and ARM64 Platform
Our applications in AWS are x86 with the exception of BrillianIDEAS (ARM64). Testing on ARM64 resulted in login issues with BrillianCRM, ICM, and Quiz that require proper debugging. Developers using Macs with M-series chips may experience compatibility issues in their local development environments.

### Setting up Docker

Docker is the best way to develop your apps. If you use Mac or Windows, install Docker Desktop from the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/), which also sets up Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). If you use Linux, install the [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/) plugin using Docker's official docs.

Each repository comes equipped with:

- **Dockerfiles**: These are scripts used by Docker to automatically build image files.
- **docker-compose.yml**: A file that defines how Docker containers should be built, configured and run. The container images will be created using the Dockerfiles.
- **docker-compose-AWS.yml**: For AWS deployment, instead of building the images from the Dockerfile, it pulls the images from the GitHub repository. See the [deployment page](aws/deployment) for more details.

#### Docker Commands

Navigate to the repository directory and use the following commands:

- To start Docker containers:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

- To rebuild the images:

```shell
docker compose up -d --build
```

- For a complete rebuild (useful when changes are not reflecting):

```shell
docker compose up -d --build --force-recreate
```

- For locally testing the AWS deployment:

```shell
docker compose -f docker-compose-AWS.yml up -d
```

### Alternative Setup Without Docker

If for any reason you opt not to use Docker, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed for running BrilianQuiz, IMBIT-N3XT, and BrillianDOCS. The typical command to start the applications is:

```shell
npm start
```

Applications like BrillianIDEAS, BrillianCRM, and BrillianICM have been dockerized due to their more complex setups. However if you want to develop without Docker you will need Apache for BrillianIDEAS, and for BrillianCRM/ICM you will requiere a more complex setup involving Java SDK, Tomcat, and Maven.

## Contributing

The power of collaboration lies in your hands! Here's how to get started:

### Creating Your Branch

When you're ready to contribute, create a new branch in the respective repository named `firstname_lastname`. If you are working on a specific feature name it with the scheme `firstname_lastname_feature`.

### Making a Pull Request (PR)

After you've made your changes, push your branch, open a pull request and merge it against the main branch. This will trigger the Continuous Deployment (CD) Pipeline, which deploys to AWS (BrillianIDEAS, BrillianQUIZ, BrillianCRM/ICM, IMBIT-N3XT) or GitHub Pages (BrillianDOCS).

Once your contributions have been merged, feel free to delete your branches.

### GitHub Organization Settings

Our GitHub organization is set to private, but individual repositories are public. We recommend to future student to rework the GitHub settings, including the integration of Dependabot for dependency updates and enabling security alerts.
