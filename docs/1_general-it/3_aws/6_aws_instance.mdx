:::danger EC2 Instance and Volume Deletion
Be careful when shutting down EC2 instances. Their storage volumes will also be removed, which will cause data loss! Read more about [data loss potential](data#data-loss-potential).

## Shell Access and SSH Key

You usually don't need direct VM access because of the PaaS nature of Elastic Beanstalk, however you can access your EC2 instances within the AWS EC2 Dashboard. 


- **Key Name**: `IMBIT-SSH`.
- **Managed Under**: EC2 dashboard.
- **VM's Console Access**: Recommended via the AWS UI by selecting the desired instance.


## Security Groups and Traffic Rules

### Virtual Firewalls

Security groups in EC2 serve as virtual firewalls that dictate inbound and outbound traffic rules for instances.

- **Instance-Specific Groups**: Auto-generated when deploying the Beanstalk application with the suffix `-env`.
- **General IMBIT Group**: The `IMBIT-SecurityGroup` allows all HTTP and HTTPS traffic across both IPv4 and IPv6.

### Enabling External SSH Access

If SSH access from outside AWS is required, it must be explicitly added within the `IMBIT-SecurityGroup` rules.


:::danger Modifying Security Groups
Changing security groups for EC2 instances, will result in data loss as AWS will create complete new EC2 instances! Instead adjust the `IMBIT-SecurityGroup` rules. Read more about [data loss potential](data#data-loss-potential).

## Volumes and Scaling
- **Storage**: Volumes are provisioned with 8GB by default, 100 IOPS, and come as General Purpose SSDs (gp2).
- **Auto Scaling Groups**: Elastic Beanstalk creates automatically scaling groups for each application. The default setting is a single instance.
