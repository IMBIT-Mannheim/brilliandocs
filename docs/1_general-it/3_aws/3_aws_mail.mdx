## AWS WorkMail Configuration

### Mailbox Management

:::note Accessing WorkMail
To sign in to the mailbox, visit the [AWS WorkMail portal](https://brillianideas.awsapps.com/mail) and use the credentials from Bitwarden.
:::

- **Mail-Domain**: `mail.brillianideas.com`
- **Current User**: `no-reply@mail.brillianideas.com`

:::caution Organization Management
Maintain a **single organization and mailbox** within WorkMail to keep billing in check. AWS charges per user/month, so consolidating users is key to cost-efficiency.

## AWS Simple Email Service (SES) Setup
We rely on AWS SES for sending and receiving emails.

### Sending Emails
The following settings have been applied for proper Email sending:

- **Domain Verification**: Confirm ownership by configuring DNS records (records can be added automatically via the AWS UI).
- **Mailbox Verification**: Validate the mailbox user (`no-reply@mail.brillianideas.com`) through an email confirmation link.
- **'Mail From' Domain**: Configured as `mail.brillianideas.com`. Ignore the "Mail From Datensatz ist nicht ausgerichtet" message; it's not an issue for `brillianideas.com`, not `mail.brillianideas.com`.
- **DMARC & DKIM**: Manual creation of the DMARC TXT setting and utilizing 2048-bit AWS managed DKIM keys.

:::tip Email Deliverability Test
Use [mail-tester.com](https://mail-tester.com) to check your email's spam score. BrillianQuiz scores 10/10, while BrillianCRM/ICM scores 8.5/10 due to short message lengths. To use Mail-Tester, enter the test email address as the recipient, for example, when registering a user in the Brilliant Apps.

### Receiving Emails

Two critical AWS SES rulesets are necessary to receive emails correctly:

1. **Receipt Rulesets (Empfangsregels√§tze)**: Define conditions like recipient domain (`mail.brillianideas.com`) and the action `routing to WorkMail ARN` with the value `arn:aws:workmail:eu-west-1:995617718697:organization/m-50c14c5d981a422bb2eadb9dd0f0fad5`.
2. **IP Address Filter**: Allows all connections (`0.0.0.0/0`).

## SMTP Credentials and Sending Settings

An SMTP user, created via [AWS IAM](/general-it/aws/iam#1-ses-smtp-user). The settings for sending mail are typically:

- **Port**: 587 (Secure, with TLS)
- **Server**: email-smtp.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com

Credentials for the SMTP user are stored in Bitwarden.
