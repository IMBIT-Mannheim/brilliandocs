## Source Code Access

To access the source code, you'll need to join the ranks of the [IMBIT-Mannheim](https://github.com/IMBIT-Mannheim). It is home to all current applications and it is imperative that we continue to uphold this for all future projects.

Should you wish to join into the organization, please extend your request to our designated contact listed at the bottom of this page.

## Passwords

The realm of IMBIT is not only built on code but also on credentials. In our quest for a more accessible credentials, we have transitioned from Keepass to the online vault of [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com). This digital vault can be accessed through any web portal, ensuring that you, can retrieve the needed secrets without the confines of a single device.

You'll find the credentials to the Bitwarden account placed within the GitHub repository, or they can be requested directly through the people below.

## Contact List

To gain access, we recommend inquiring with the Studiengangsleitung for the last individual who had access, and approach them to obtain the Bitwarden credentials and a GitHub invitation. If the trail runs cold and no contact is known, do not hesitate to reach out to one of the contacts listed below. Also, consider adding your details to the list to streamline future endeavors.
