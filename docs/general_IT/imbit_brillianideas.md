[IMBIT.BrillianIdeas](https://imbit.brillianideas.com) is an unfinished, legacy webpage originating from a collaborative effort in 2021 under the guidance of Prof Krug. This page serves as an information hub crafted by and for the students of IMBIT@DHBW-Mannheim.

The platform is built on a Wordpress instance and is currently hosted on AWS Lightsail. For administrative tasks you can access the [Wordpress admin interface](https://imbit.brillianideas.com/wp-admin).

## Credentials Management

All necessary credentials to access and manage the Wordpress page are securely stored in Bitwarden.

## Hosting and Maintenance

As of the last update, the SSL certificate for the site has expired, and restoration attempts via Lightsail's integrated certificate management have been unsuccessful.
Shell access is possible through AWS Lightsail's management console at [AWS Lightsail Console](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/). Any student or faculty member who is technically inclined and eager to address the SSL issue or improve the webpage is encouraged to do so.
