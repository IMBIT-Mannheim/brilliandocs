## Joining the IMBIT GitHub Organization

You can access the source code for all applications once you're part of the [IMBIT-Mannheim GitHub Organization](https://github.com/IMBIT-Mannheim). Please respect, that we need to keep all code for ongoing and future projects in that GitHub organization.

To join the organization, send a request to a person the end of this [section](#contact-list).

## Password Manager

We've chosen [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.eu) (EU-Server), an user-friendly online password manager to simplify password sharing.

### Obtaining Bitwarden Credentials

To find the Bitwarden account credentials:

- If you are in the GitHub organization you will find the credentials [here](https://github.com/IMBIT-Mannheim).
- Alternatively, request them from the students from higher semesters.

## Reaching Out for Access

If you're uncertain about how to proceed or whom to contact for access, follow these steps:

1. Ask the Studiengangsleitung for the name of the last person responsible for the resources you're interested in.
2. Contact that individual to obtain both Bitwarden credentials and a GitHub invitation.
3. In case you hit a dead end, don't worryâ€”the contacts below can help you out.
